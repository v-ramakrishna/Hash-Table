// Description: This program prompts the user to enter a size and generates a hash table.
//              The hash table is then populated until the user enters a value to stop inserting. The program will then
//              ask how many commands the user wishes to enter, and will keep asking a user to enter the next choice
//              until the desired number of commands have been issued. This file is the main driver file for the program.

// Hash Function
// The hash function is h(k) = âˆ‘(ascii_value_of_character * numerical_position_of_character/2), where k is the Key

// Hash Analysis
// I had to try several different hash functions before ultimately deciding to use the one which I used. Initially, I tried just counting
// the number of the characters in the key, and finding the modulus for this value and the number of tables. This was not a good function
// because many of the keys are the same length, particularly where teams are concerned. For example, with the sample input file, all teams
// doing the same event will be put into the same Linked List. So, I tried using an ASCII-converter next, summing up the ASCII values of the
// key to determine where to place it. This had a similar issue to the previous function, as many of the keys are quite similar. So, I added the
// additional qualifier of multiplying the ASCII value by the character's position divided by 2. This caused sufficient diversity in the outputs for the
// hash function to be a useful hash function.
//
// The expected number of collisions, given a relatively equal distribution should be equal to the load factor for the hash table. In the case of the input
// data provided, there are a total of 43 entries distributed among 13 Linked Lists. This means, on average, each list should have 3.3 items, and on average,
// 2.3 collisions will take place. This is seen using the sample data, where most lists have 3 or 4 entries.
